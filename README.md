This is me fiddling with stuff trying to get expo to play nice with internal package dependencies in a yarn workspaces environment.

To start:
- cd into root of project: `yarn install`
- `yarn workspace @streem/sdk-core install` (might be required if i havent fixed the watching feature)
- npx expo start
